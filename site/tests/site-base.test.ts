// The base this site is deployed at is read from the environment in exactly one module.
//
// Eighteen files used to read it for themselves, every one of them writing the same line:
// `import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, '')`. That is eighteen private answers to a question
// the shell also answers, and the shell's answer is the one the header and footer resolve their
// links against. While the answers agree nothing is visible; the day one of them stops agreeing,
// half the page points somewhere the other half does not.
//
// It is not only drift. Two shapes of this are wrong the moment they are written, and both build
// green:
//
//   - reading BASE_URL without stripping. At the domain root it is `/`, the strip is a no-op, and
//     every href comes out right — so dev and any root deploy confirm the bug. Under
//     `/statistical-genomics-foundry/` the same code emits a doubled slash before every path.
//   - stripping with something subtly different, e.g. trimming a leading slash too. Nothing here
//     renders an error; the links simply land somewhere else.
//
// So the rule is the single reader, not the correct expression: `src/lib/site-base.ts`, which
// takes the definition from `shellBase` in @galaxy-foundry/site-kit — the same function the shell
// resolves the nav with. Everything else imports `base` from there.
