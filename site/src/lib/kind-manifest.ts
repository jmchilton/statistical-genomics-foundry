// This Foundry's kind manifest — the machine-readable form of "what kinds does this
// Foundry define, and what metadata does each require".
//
// The FORMAT, the zod-shape deriver, and the reader all live in
// @galaxy-foundry/kind-manifest, because they are shared across instances (spec:
// galaxyproject/foundry-pattern, `content/pattern/standing-up-a-foundry.instructions.txt`).
// What stays here is the part that is genuinely ours: which kinds exist, and how this
// instance's registries resolve into the context they are built against.
//
// `fields` is still DERIVED from the zod shape, never hand-written — that has just moved
// one repo over, along with the synthetic-shape tests that prove the deriver right.
