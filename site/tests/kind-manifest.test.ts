// What this instance owes the manifest format, now that the format itself lives in
// @galaxy-foundry/kind-manifest.
//
// The synthetic-shape suite that used to live here — does `describeType` unwrap a
// defaulted array, does a refined string still render as `string` — moved to that package
// along with the renderer it exercises. Re-testing a dependency's unit behaviour here
// would just be the duplication this extraction removed, in a new place.
//
// What is still ours, and only testable here: that OUR kinds resolve against OUR
// registries into a manifest that is well-formed, complete, and stable enough for the
// `check:kinds` gate to mean something.
