// What makes this site THIS site, in one place.
//
// The shell — Base, Header, Footer — is within a handful of lines of the parent Foundry's, and
// every one of those lines is a value rather than a decision: the name in the wordmark, the name
// in the footer, the description, the width of the column. Naming them here is worth doing on its
// own terms, and it is also what would have to happen first if the shell were ever to be shared:
// what remains after this is markup, and markup is the part that could move.
//
// The two names are one string here and two over there — that instance is "Foundry" in its own
// header and "Galaxy Workflow Foundry" at the bottom of the page. Both are declared anyway, so
// the two files have the same shape and a reader comparing them is comparing values.

/** Short name: the header wordmark and the `<title>` suffix. */

/**
 * The measure of the reading column, as a Tailwind class.
 *
 * NOT this site's to choose, unlike everything above it — both instances now carry the same value.
 * This one used to be one step narrower than the parent's, and that difference was never
 * decided: this shell was copied from that one two months later, and the width changed in the same
 * edit as the name and the description. Neither repo touched it again.
 *
 * Nor does either corpus defend a value. The prose measure is set by narrowing locally on the
 * pages that want it — this instance does that a dozen times, two and three steps in, across
 * eight index pages — so this is only the outer bound for tables and grids, where the parent has
 * the heavier load.
 *
 * It lives here because it has to live somewhere until the shell is shared, and it is the first
 * thing that should LEAVE this file when it is: a shared component can hold one measure and take
 * no prop for it.
 *
 * Two notes on spelling, one mechanism behind both: Tailwind finds utilities by scanning source
 * TEXT, comments included. So the value is written out in full rather than assembled — from
 * pieces (`max-w-${size}`) it would find nothing, emit no rule, and the page would build clean and
 * render full-bleed. And the widths above are described rather than named, because this file
 * briefly shipped a rule for a width nothing used, on the strength of a comment mentioning it.
 *
 * Base, Header and Footer each carried a copy of this, free to disagree —
 * `tests/built-shell.test.ts` asserts the three agree.
