// One reader for "which facet declared this tag", and what it does with the answer.
//
// The registry decides membership. A page that asks it, then re-decides what to do with the
// answer, has not really deferred: the browse order, the empty-facet rule and the absence of an
// "other" bucket are all decisions, and each call site that takes them again is a place they can
// be taken differently. They were — the tags index and the drift check reasoned about the same
// grouping in two shapes, and neither could tell you it was disagreeing.
//
// Behaviour is asserted against a SYNTHETIC registry rather than the repo's own. A real registry
// whose vocabulary is entirely slashed cannot distinguish "grouped by declaration" from "grouped
// by the text before the slash", which is the one confusion this code exists to prevent — so the
// fixture below carries a bare tag and a tag whose prefix names the wrong facet.
