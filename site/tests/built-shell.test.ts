// The document shell's contract, asserted on what the build actually emitted.
//
// Base.astro, Header.astro and Footer.astro have no unit behaviour worth testing — they are
// markup. What they DO have is a contract with the reader that no other check can see: a skip
// link that lands somewhere, a theme applied before first paint, and a stylesheet that actually
// carries the utilities the markup names. Every one of those fails green. The page builds, the
// HTML is well-formed, and the site is broken.
//
// This exists ahead of any attempt to share these components with the parent Foundry, whose
// copies differ from these by a description string, a title suffix and a container width. A test
// written after a swap proves nothing about what the swap changed, so it is written against the
// hand-rolled components first and is expected to pass unaltered afterwards. If sharing them
// never happens, this is still the only thing standing between the shell and a silent regression.
//
// The stylesheet assertion is the one to understand before editing. Tailwind 4 emits a utility
// only where it finds the class in a source file it was told to scan. Move the markup somewhere
// unscanned — a package under node_modules, say — and the class disappears from the CSS while
// every page still references it. Nothing errors. The page renders unstyled. `min-h-dvh` is the
// canary because Base.astro is the only file in this repo that names it, so its presence in the
// emitted CSS is evidence that the layout specifically was scanned.
//
// That canary was self-defeating when written. This directory sits INSIDE the Vite root, so
// automatic source detection scanned it, and naming `min-h-dvh` in the line below was enough to
// put the class in the stylesheet: the assertion passed with the class deleted from the layout.
// `global.css` now carries `@source not "../../tests"`, which is worth having on its own terms —
// no test string should reach the shipped CSS. Found by deliberately breaking the layout and
// watching the test pass anyway, which is the only way this kind of thing is ever found.
